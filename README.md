The Weather App is a simple, user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API), the app allows users to search for weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
