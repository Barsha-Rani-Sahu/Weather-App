# Weather-App
The Weather App is a simple web-based application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any location worldwide. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API), the app provides real-time weather updates including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
