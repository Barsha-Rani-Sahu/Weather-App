I developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with an integrated Weather API to fetch real-time weather data. This app allows users to search for any city and view live weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

✨ Features<br>
✅ Live Weather Updates – Fetches real-time weather data from an API.<br>
✅ City Search Functionality – Enter any city name to get instant weather details.<br>
✅ Weather Details Display – Shows temperature 🌡️, humidity 💧, wind speed 🌬️, and conditions ☁️.<br>
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Clean and modern design for an enhanced experience.<br>
